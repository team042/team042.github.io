        <p style="color:rgb(181,181,181)"><br>This project uses deep belief neural networks to analyze Supply Chain and global events data to predict and visualize the scale of disruption. These insights are delivered through an interactive map allowing for data filtering and clearly illustrating relationships between geography, trade and disruptive global events. The modern era of globalization has led to the development of increasingly complex Supply Chain networks optimized for low cost under normal operation. While this trend has enabled novel business models and widespread availability of low-cost goods and services, it has also led to increasing supply network opacity and susceptibility to shock events. These weaknesses were made clear in 2020 when complications from the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated Supply Chain fragility of many companies, contributing to shortages and inflation as contagion management practices impacted production and transportation. Other, more localized, incidents such as the Ever Given blockage of the Suez canal in March 2021 and the May 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline have led to similar supply network issues impacting businesses geographically and logistically distant from the incident. With an increasingly complex world, it has become increasingly difficult to determine how any particular event will impact Supply Chains and how those impacts will affect various industries</p>
